# Reading 03


## Reading and writing files 
- Header: metadata about the contents of the file (file name, size, type, and so on)
- Data: contents of the file as written by the creator or editor
- End of file (EOF): special character that indicates the end of the file
- 'r'	Open for reading (default)
- 'w'	Open for writing, truncating (overwriting) the file first
- 'rb' or 'wb'	Open in binary mode

## Python Exceptions
- raise allows you to throw an exception at any time.
- assert enables you to verify if a certain condition is met and throw an exception if it isnâ€™t.
- In the try clause, all statements are executed until an exception is encountered.
- except is used to catch and handle the exception(s) that are encountered in the try clause.
- else lets you code sections that should run only when no exceptions are encountered in the try clause.
- finally enables you to execute sections of code that should always run, with or without any previously encountered exceptions.
